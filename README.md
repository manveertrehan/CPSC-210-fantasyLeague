## Fantasy Basketball Tracker

I will create a **fantasy basketball application** using players and teams from
the NBA. The application will allow a user to add players to their fantasy 
teams and track how many fantasy points their team has earned based on their *own* 
custom point system.

This application will be used by NBA fans who want to track how well their team
is doing. Personally, I have been participating in fantasy leagues for the last
few years and am interested in being able to play around with different score 
systems and rosters.

## User Stories
 
 - As a user, I want to be able to create a new team and add it to the **league** ( a list of teams)
 - As a user, I want to be able to be able to view the list of teams in the league
 - As a user, I want to be able to be able to create a new player and add it to a team
 - As a user, I want to be able to view the list of players on a team
 - As a user, I want to be able to select a player and add the numbers of *points, assists,* and *rebounds* they 
 recorded
 - As a user, I want to be able to select a player and receive the number of fantasy points they have generated
 - As a user, I want to be able to select a team and see the total number of fantasy points generated by the players on
 the team
 - As a user, I want to be able to be able to save changes made to my league, teams, and players
 - As a user, I want to be able to load my league when I start the application
 
 ## Phase 4: Task 2
 
 Bi-directional association in classes Player and Team in model package, used
 in methods setTeam(), addPlayer(), and removeTeam().
 
 ## Phase 4: Task 3
 
 - EditLeagueMenu and EditTeamMenu have a substantial amount of 
 extremely similar methods and the two classes are structured very 
 similarily. If I had more time to refactor I would add a Menu abstract
 class in order to remove a lot of that duplication
 - I could have avoided EditLeagueMenu and EditTeamMenu having an asscociation
 with team by getting the league through a bidirectional association back to FantasyLeague
